# Spacely-Caribou

Spacely-Caribou is an architecture in which an ASIC is tested primarily using Caribou hardware (ZCU102 + CaR board), driven by Spacely software. 

As a fully open-source system, Spacely-Caribou allows great flexibility across the entire stack. Please see the following notes depending on which area you are working on:
