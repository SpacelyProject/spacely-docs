# Peary Device Files

Peary Device Files are a collection of three C++ files that tell Peary how to communicate with your chip:

- SpacelyCaribouBasicDevice.cpp
- SpacelyCaribouBasicDevice.hpp
- SpacelyCaribouBasicDefaults.hpp


The only file you need to modify is SpacelyCaribouBasicDefaults.hpp. In this file, find the section labeled 



You do **NOT** need to modify the other files and can leave them just the way they are in the Peary repo.
